                    Hi! My name is Henry Susantin and I'm a current CSE student at UC Irvine. I'm a problem solver at heart,
                    with an affinity for computer science and new subjects. In my spare time, I enjoy video games, music mixing,
                    composition, and playing, as well as making quirky side projects for my own amusement.
                </p>
